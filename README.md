# RoomVU iOS assessment

## Assumption
1. There was an issue in openapi.yaml and I created a local JSON file.
2. The JSON file has keys with information visible in the Figma Design
3. JSON file does not have "location" key. This how the app puts N/A for location. If "location" key is presented, it will be shown in profile page
4. Some navigations were not clear in Figma. For example, Figma does not specify what Next button on Page 2 does
5. Based on Figma, user can tap on a photo on Page 2 and goes to Page 3
6. Figma does not specify where to go after the image processed on Page 4
